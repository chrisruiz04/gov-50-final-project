## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to education. I volunteer at the Cambridge After School Program near Alewife and would love to see if I can collect data through surveys of the students about their thoughts on the effectiveness of the program, or really anything related to education. I don't really know how this will manifest itself, but its a good place to start and I'm excited to brainstorm!
